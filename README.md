# Automated-Warehouse-Inventory
An automated warehouse system where users can manage inventories and get updates on the go. Built with modular functions to attend to integration possibilities. 

# Reason 
Had friends working on cashier/POS system which was not integrated with an inventory management system. They had to manually insert and write
for each things, daily. I went ahead to try make one, apparently the concept is super simple, especially if you have ids to refer to in the inventory
for every successful transaction.

# What it solves
- abolish manual stock counting, stock database management, stock to consider to order, to replenish, to restock on expiry basis

# What I learnt
- Inventory management basics, principles, what it differs than POS system, how it differs from price-tagged managers

# More to implement
Basically there's more to implement, currently the app would serve as the base of it. 

- supplier list system, with options to optionalize each items from each supplier 
- invoice pdf generators for each suppliers with items in deficit and stocks to with its own metrics
- integration function to complement current POS systems without inventory systems
